> ### Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-higher_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
---


> ### Shell Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
All your files must be executable
---

> ### C Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

> ### 0. My first square mandatory
Write an empty class Square that defines a square:

You are not allowed to import any module

> ### 1. Square with size mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)
You are not allowed to import any module
Why?

Why size is private attribute?

The size of a square is crucial for a square, many things depend of it (area computation, etc.), so you, as class builder, must control the type and value of this attribute. One way to have the control is to keep it privately. You will see in next tasks how to get, update and validate the size value.

> ### Size validation mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
You are not allowed to import any module
---
> ### 3. Area of a square mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
You are not allowed to import any module

> ### 4. Access and update private attribute mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
You are not allowed to import any module
Why?

Why a getter and setter?

Reminder: size is a private attribute. We did that to make sure we control the type and value. Getter and setter methods are not 100% Python, but more OOP. With them, you will be able to validate the assignment of a private attribute and also define how getting the attribute value will be available from outside - by copy? by assignment? etc. Also, adding type/value validation in the setter will centralize the logic, since you will do it in only one place.

> ### 5. Printing a square mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 6. Coordinates of a square mandatory
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Private instance attribute: position:
property def position(self): to retrieve it
property setter def position(self, value): to set it:
position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers
Instantiation with optional size and optional position: def __init__(self, size=0, position=(0, 0)):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
position should be use by using space - Don’t fill lines by spaces when position[1] > 0
You are not allowed to import any module
