> ### Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-higher_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
---


> ### Shell Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
All your files must be executable
---

> ### C Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

> ### 0. Safe list printing mandatory
Write a function that prints x elements of a list.

Prototype: def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0):
my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
All elements must be printed on the same line followed by a new line.
x represents the number of elements to print
x can be bigger than the length of my_list
Returns the real number of elements printed
You have to use try: / except:
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use len()

> ###  1. Safe printing of an integers list mandatory
Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().

Prototype: def safe_print_integer(value):
value can be any type (integer, string, etc.)
The integer should be printed followed by a new line
Returns True if value has been correctly printed (it means the value is an integer)
Otherwise, returns False
You have to use try: / except:
You have to use "{:d}".format() to print as integer
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use type()
---

> ### 2. Print and count integers mandatory
Write a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.

Prototype: def safe_print_list_integers(my_list=[], x=0):
my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
All integers have to be printed on the same line followed by a new line - other type of value in the list must be skipped (in silence).
x represents the number of elements to access in my_list
x can be bigger than the length of my_list - if it’s the case, an exception will occur
Returns the real number of integers printed
You have to use try: / except:
You have to use "{:d}".format() to print an integer
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use len()
---

> ### 3. Integers division with debug mandatory
Write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.

Prototype: def safe_print_division(a, b):
You can assume that a and b are integers
The result of the division should print on the finally: section preceded by Inside result:
Returns the value of the division, otherwise: None
You have to use try: / except: / finally:
You have to use "{}".format() to print the result
You are not allowed to import any module

> ### 4. Divide a list mandatory
Write a function that divides element by element 2 lists.

Prototype: def list_division(my_list_1, my_list_2, list_length):
my_list_1 and my_list_2 can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
list_length can be bigger than the length of both lists
Returns a new list (length = list_length) with all divisions
If 2 elements can’t be divided, the division result should be equal to 0
If an element is not an integer or float:
print: wrong type
If the division can’t be done (/0):
print: division by 0
If my_list_1 or my_list_2 is too short
print: out of range
You have to use try: / except: / finally:
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 5. Raise exception mandatory
Write a function that raises a type exception.

Prototype: def raise_exception():
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ###  6. Raise a message mandatory
Write a function that raises a name exception with a message.

Prototype: def raise_exception_msg(message=""):
You are not allowed to import any module
