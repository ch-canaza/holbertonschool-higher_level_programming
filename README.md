> ### Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-higher_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
---


> ### Shell Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
All your files must be executable
---

> ### C Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
---

> ### Python Test Cases
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

> ### 0.Integers addition mandatory
Write a function that adds 2 integers.

Prototype: def add_integer(a, b=98):
a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer
a and b must be first casted to integers if they are float
Returns an integer: the addition of a and b
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 1. Divide a matrix mandatory
Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

Prototype: def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
Each row of the matrix must be of the same size, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message Each row of the matrix must have the same size
div must be a number (integer or float), otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message div must be a number
div can’t be equal to 0, otherwise raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message division by zero
All elements of the matrix should be divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places
Returns a new matrix
You are not allowed to import any module

---
> ### Say my name mandatory
Write a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>

Prototype: def say_my_name(first_name, last_name=""):
first_name and last_name must be strings otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message first_name must be a string or last_name must be a string
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### Print square mandatory
Write a function that prints a square with the character #.

Prototype: def print_square(size):
size is the size length of the square
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
if size is a float and is less than 0, raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ###Text indentation mandatory
Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :

Prototype: def text_indentation(text):
text must be a string, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message text must be a string
There should be no space at the beginning or at the end of each printed line
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 6. Max integer - Unittest mandatory
Since the beginning you have been creating “Interactive tests”. For this exercise, you will add Unittests.

In this task, you will write unittests for the function def max_integer(list=[]):.

Your test file should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module
Your test file should be python files (extension: .py)
Your test file should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests.6-max_integer_test
All tests you make must be passable by the function below
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
