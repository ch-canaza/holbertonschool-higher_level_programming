> ### Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-higher_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
---


> ### Shell Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
All your files must be executable
---

> ### C Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

---

> ### 0. Read file mandatory
Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:

Prototype: def read_file(filename=""):
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.
You are not allowed to import any module
---


> ### 1. Number of lines mandatory
Write a function that returns the number of lines of a text file:

Prototype: def number_of_lines(filename=""):
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 2.  Read n lines mandatory
Write a function that reads n lines of a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:

Prototype: def read_lines(filename="", nb_lines=0):
Read the entire file if nb_lines is lower or equal to 0 OR greater or equal to the total number of lines of the file
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 3. Write to a file mandatory
Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written:

Prototype: def write_file(filename="", text=""):
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage file permission exceptions.
Your function should create the file if doesn’t exist.
Your function should overwrite the content of the file if it already exists.
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 4.  Append to a file mandatory
Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added:

Prototype: def append_write(filename="", text=""):
If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 5. To JSON string mandatory
Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string):

Prototype: def to_json_string(my_obj):
You don’t need to manage exceptions if the object can’t be serialized.
---


> ### 6. From JSON string to Object mandatory
Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string:

Prototype: def from_json_string(my_str):
You don’t need to manage exceptions if the JSON string doesn’t represent an object.
---

> ###  Save Object to a file mandatory
Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation:

Prototype: def save_to_json_file(my_obj, filename):
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage exceptions if the object can’t be serialized.
You don’t need to manage file permission exceptions.
---

> ### 8.Create object from a JSON file mandatory
Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”:

Prototype: def load_from_json_file(filename):
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage exceptions if the JSON string doesn’t represent an object.
You don’t need to manage file permissions / exceptions.
---

> ### 9. Load, add, save mandatory
Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file:

You must use your function save_to_json_file from 7-save_to_json_file.py
You must use your function load_from_json_file from 8-load_from_json_file.py
The list must be saved as a JSON representation in a file named add_item.json
If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created
You don’t need to manage file permissions / exceptions.
---

> ### 10. Class to JSON mandatory
Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object:

Prototype: def class_to_json(obj):
obj is an instance of a Class
All attributes of the obj Class are serializable: list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 11. Student to JSON mandatory
Write a class Student that defines a student by:

Public instance attributes:
first_name
last_name
age
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 10-class_to_json.py)
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 12. Student to JSON with filter mandatory
Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 11-student.py)

Public instance attributes:
first_name
last_name
age
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self, attrs=None): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 10-class_to_json.py):
If attrs is a list of strings, only attribute names contained in this list must be retrieved.
Otherwise, all attributes must be retrieved
You are not allowed to import any module
---

> ### 13 Student to disk and reload mandatory
Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 12-student.py)

Public instance attributes:
first_name
last_name
age
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self, attrs=None): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 10-class_to_json.py):
If attrs is a list of strings, only attributes name contain in this list must be retrieved.
Otherwise, all attributes must be retrieved
Public method def reload_from_json(self, json): that replaces all attributes of the Student instance:
You can assume json will always be a dictionary
A dictionary key will be the public attribute name
A dictionary value will be the value of the public attribute
You are not allowed to import any module
Now, you have a simple implementation of a serialization and deserialization mechanism (concept of representation of an object to another format, without losing any information and allow us to rebuild an object based on this representation)
---

> ### 14. Pascal's Triangle mandatory
Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:

Returns an empty list if n <= 0
You can assume n will be always an integer
